# Work on project. Stage 3/4: Main content
Hyperblog HTML
<hr />

# Main content

## Description
In this stage, you will add the main content for the blog. Begin by enclosing the whole content in a `<main>` tag. Within the `<main>` tag, create a `<section>` tag to bundle the articles. Each article should be enclosed within an `<article>` tag.
For the first article, include a title of your choice with an `<h3>` heading. Beneath the heading, insert an `<i>` tag to show the publication date. Write a brief paragraph within a `<p>` tag to preview the content of the article. Assuming the article is about programming, include a code snippet using the <code> tag within a `<p>` tag, displaying something like `console.log("Hello, World!")`. Also, add a video using the `<video>` tag with the `control`s attribute and a `src` attribute that directs to the video file.
For the second article, repeat the process. Include a distinct title, publication date, and a paragraph introducing the content. This time, however, include a quote. Within a `<blockquote>` tag, use a `<q>` tag to show a quote from an interview. In conclusion, embed an audio file using the `<audio>` tag with the `controls` attribute and a `src` attribute directing to the audio file.
Always remember to close all the tags correctly and make sure your HTML code is well-structured.

## Objectives
In this stage, you are required to:
* Insert the `<main>` tag within the body of the blog template.
* In the `<main>` tag, create a `<section>` tag to group 2 articles.

* Beneath each heading, show the publication date using the `<i>` tag.
* Write a brief paragraph using the `<p>` tag to introduce the content of each article.
* For the first article, present a code snippet using the `<code>` tag within a `<p>` tag.
* Embed a video in the first article using the `<video>` tag with the `controls` attribute and a `src` attribute directing to the video file.
* For the second article, use the `<blockquote>` tag to present a quote from an interview.
* Within the `<blockquote>` tag, use the `<q>` tag to show the quote.
* Embed an audio file in the second article using the `<audio>` tag with the `controls` attribute and a `src` attribute pointing to the audio file.
