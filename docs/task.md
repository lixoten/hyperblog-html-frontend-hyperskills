# Work on project. Stage 2/4: Aside content
Hyperblog HTML
<hr />

# Aside content

## Description
* In the second stage, you have to include an `<aside>` element in the blog template. The `<aside>` element signifies a section on the page containing content related to the main content, yet can be regarded as separate.
* Inside the `<aside>` element, incorporate an `<h2>` header with any content, for instance, "Popular Articles". To build an ordered list of popular articles, employ the `<ol>` tag with the `type="I`" attribute; this will show the list items with uppercase Roman numerals. Each list item should encompass an anchor link (`<a>`) with a placeholder href attribute.
* By adding this `<aside>` element, you will enhance the structure and provide additional content to the blog template.

## Objectives
In this stage, you are required to:
* Add the `<aside>` tag within the body of the blog template.
* Within the `<aside>` tag, use the `<h2>` tag to craft a header for the "Popular Articles" section (or any other title).
* Use the `<ol>` tag to construct an ordered list for the articles.
* Assign the `type` attribute of the `<ol>` tag to "I" to display uppercase Roman numerals.
* In the `<ol>` tag, generate 3 individual list items with the `<li>` tag.
* Inside each `<li>` tag, include an anchor link (`<a>`) with a placeholder `href` attribute.
* Replicate this structure for each article, adjusting the text and `href` attribute for each list item.
