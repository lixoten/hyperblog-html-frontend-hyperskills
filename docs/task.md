# Work on project. Stage 4/4: Footer content
Hyperblog HTML
<hr />

# Footer content

## Description
Finish your blog page by including a footer section using HTML. You can create the footer by enclosing the content within a `<footer>` tag.

Within the `<footer>` tag, add a heading `<h2>` with any text, like "Contact Us" to signify the footer's purpose. Then, insert an email link using the `<a>` tag with the `href` attribute directed to the email address, for instance, "hello@hyperblog.com". This way, users can contact you via email.

Underneath the email link, employ the `<address>` tag to show the address details. You can include the city, state, postal code, and country information.

Lastly, use a paragraph `<p>` to exhibit the copyright statement. You may Include the symbol '©', the current year, and the name of your website. For example, it can be "© 2024 Hyperblog".

Ensure you close all the tags properly and that your HTML code is well-structured. After you finish this step, your web page will display a footer section at the bottom containing the contact information and copyright statement.
